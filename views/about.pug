      h1 About Me
      p I grew up in Miami, Florida in the 80s and 90s. And ever since I was young I had a fascination with technology. I would spend hours playing with (and sometimes breaking) anything with buttons. And we were lucky enough to have a computer in our home, since my parents ran a small business. Ostensibly it was for taxes and such, but to me it was a wonder machine with many games and infinite possibilities. Sure, I played various flight simulators and SimCity. But I also printed out birthday cards, wrote book reports, and occasionally I even did a little BASIC programming.
