      p I've learned a lot in my 5 years as a professional web developer. In that time, I've worked on API integrations, custom Content Management Systems, data migrations, and many responsive layouts. But I also recognize that there is still (and probably always will be) things for me to learn and improve upon. I love learning, so this actually works wout well for me. One of my main goals as a developer is to always strive for continuous improvement.

      p But skills aren't all that I have going for me. I also have a passion for web development in general, and front-end development in particular. I care very much about the quality of things that I build. I regularly read articles to help myself stay current. And I have done presentations at company meetings on subjects like: CSS Preprocessors, Flexbox, Workflow &amp; Automation, and most recently Progressive Web Apps.
