          The WUSATA web app evolved quite a bit over the years, and I was involved in updates ranging from data migrations
          to CRUD implementations to data visualizations, and much more.
          And though I was involved in many updates to the system, one of the most challenging and rewarding updates was the implementation of
          a map visualization builder. I was the primary developer for the front-end portion of that project, which utilized leaflet.js. The project
          involved displaying data points with custom data tooltips, generating visualizations based on the data points, and writing a
          custom leaflet plugin to allow for enhanced filtering capabilities.
        </p><p>
          Another challenging project that I was involved in was a data migration from a series of legacy databases into the WUSATA web app.
          The migration involved pulling from hundreds of thousands of records across more than 800 tables.

          One area of the site that I was involved in was the Work List page, which you can see
          <a href="https://www.avibeweb.com/work/" target="_blank">here</a>. Another area I was involved in was the top navigation, which you can see
          all over the site. I was the primary developer for both of these efforts, both of which used a fair amount of animation. And finally, this is
          another project where I was responsible for the Gulp script.
